### Explanation of the Script

1. Connection: The script connects to the IB paper trading account using the specified port (7496).
2. Retrieving Positions: It retrieves all open positions using
ib.positions()
.
3. Market Data: For each position, it requests market data to get the current price.
4. Data Collection: It collects the required data, including WKN (using
conId
as a placeholder), initial price, fees, open quantity, profit/loss, and expiration date if applicable.
5. Output: Finally, it prints the collected data for each open position.

### Note

- The WKN (Wertpapierkennnummer) is not directly available through the
ib-insync
API. You may need to map the
conId
to the actual WKN using an external database or API if required.
- The fees calculation in this example is simplified. You may need to adjust it based on your specific fee structure.
- Ensure that your IB Gateway or TWS is running and configured to accept API connections.
